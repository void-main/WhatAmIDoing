*Peeking at yourself*

## Inspiration
I'm reading the [old diary](http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nscpdorm.html) written by Jamie Zawinski about his life at Mosaic, which turned to netscape later.

As he written, 

> There's finally an Indy on my desk instead of a Sun4. This means that I also have an IndyCam, so I hacked up a script to grab and save a frame of me sitting there every five minutes. 

I think it's cool, so I've built this small script that takes your photo from your laptop's webcam and save them locally, so you can peek at yourself later.

## Requirements
I'm using [ImageSnap](http://iharder.sourceforge.net/current/macosx/imagesnap/) to take pictures, and I've appended the compiled version in the folder, but it's recommended that you build one for yourself.

This is a ruby script, so ruby is required.

## Get it working
Crack into this folder, and type `./peeker`, and start showing yourself.
